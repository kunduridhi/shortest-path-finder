# shortest-path-finder
Finding the shortest path between two points is one of the most fundamental problems in computer science and mathematics. Graph theory provides an efficient way to model real-world systems such as transportation networks, social networks, and computer communication networks.
The shortest path problem involves finding the minimum distance or cost between two nodes in a graph. This project implements algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) for unweighted graphs and Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for weighted graphs to solve shortest path problems effectively.
Applications include:
1. GPS navigation systems (Google Maps, Uber)
2. Internet routing (OSPF protocol)
3. Airline route planning
3. Logistics and supply chain optimization
